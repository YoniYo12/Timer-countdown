Basic timer-countdown project using HTML , CSS and vanilla javascript!

HTML is consisted of diffrent containers which are used for the timer, imput and button components.

- the timer container show us the countdown time.
- the imput container is consisted of 3 labels which are hours, mintues, and seconds
- the button container is consisted of 3 buttons which are startcountdown, pauseresumecountdown and clearCountdown.

For the styling I used CSS and added some color animation on the egde of the time container.

The JavaScript part we used the concepts of functions and some bulit in async-functions like setInterval , clearInterval , Date. 

DOM was also used to select html components inorder for the timer to work.
